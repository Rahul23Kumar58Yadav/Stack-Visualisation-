Stack Visualization
This project is a web-based tool for visualizing the operations of a stack data structure, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users understand stack operations like push, pop, peek, and isEmpty through an interactive interface.

Features
* Push Operation: Adds an element to the stack.
* Pop Operation: Removes the top element from the stack.
* Peek Operation: Views the top element without removing it.
* Stack Status: Displays whether the stack is empty or full.
* Visual Representation: Uses animation to show each operation in real time.

Technologies Used
HTML for structuring the layout.
CSS for styling and animations.
JavaScript for implementing stack operations and updating the UI.
